# Exploratory Data Analysis of Red and White Wine üç∑üç∏

This repository contains a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) of red and white wine quality using Python libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The aim is to uncover insights from the wine datasets and understand the factors that contribute to wine quality.

## Introduction

Wine quality is determined by various chemical properties. This project explores these properties in red and white wine datasets to identify patterns, correlations, and anomalies that could influence wine quality. Through this analysis, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of what factors most significantly affect wine quality.

## Datasets

The analysis is conducted on two datasets: one for red wine and one for white wine. Each dataset includes several variables, such as alcohol percentage, acidity, pH, sugar content, and more, which are analyzed in relation to the wine's quality.

- **Red Wine Dataset:** [[Click here](https://github.com/figo2001/Complete-Wine-Data-Analysis/blob/main/winequality-red.csv)]
- **White Wine Dataset:** [[Click here](https://github.com/figo2001/Complete-Wine-Data-Analysis/blob/main/winequality-white.csv)]

## Tools Used

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn:** For making statistical graphics in Python.

## Installation

To run this analysis, you will need to install Python and the required libraries. You can install the libraries using pip:


## Usage

The analysis is split into multiple Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of the EDA process:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Preparing the datasets for analysis by cleaning and structuring them.
2. **Univariate Analysis:** Exploring individual variables to understand their distributions.
3. **Bivariate Analysis:** Investigating relationships between two variables.
4. **Multivariate Analysis:** Exploring relationships involving more than two variables to understand the interactions between them.

To run the notebooks, navigate to the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook:


## Results

Our exploratory data analysis revealed several key insights into red and white wine qualities. For instance, alcohol level, acidity, and sulphates show a positive correlation with wine quality, while volatile acidity and density show a negative correlation. Detailed findings and visualizations are available in the notebooks.
